# 14) Special String

# Alice has a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. 
# Her friend gives her another string S and asks her to modify string A and replace its characters with the characters present in string S.
# But, to achieve the above task, Alice must follow the below steps:
# 1. Choose a character from string S that has the minimum ASCII distance from the
# ith character in string A
# Replace the ith character in string A with the chosen character in string S
# Your task is to find and return an integer value, representing minimum total ASCII distance that is required to modify string A 
# to the characters in string S. Return O, if all the characters in string S are already present in string A
# Sample Input:
# abcd
# xyz
# Sample Output:86
