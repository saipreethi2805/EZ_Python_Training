# He has been tasked with determining how many commas are used when writing numbers in the range of 1 to N (inclusive) in a specific format
# In this format, 
# if numbers are more than four digits long, commas are used to separate the numbers into groups of three, 
# starting from the right for the representation of the number. 
# Your task is to help Liam find and return an integer value,
# representing the total number of commas used when writing each integer in the range of 1 to N
# Input Specification:
# Input: An integer value N. representing the number range.
# Output Specification:I
# Return an integer value, representing total number of commas used when writing each integer in the range of 1 to N.
# Sample Input: 5000
# Sample Output: 4001
